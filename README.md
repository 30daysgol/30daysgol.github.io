# 30 Days Gol

30 Days Game of Life is a challenge for people who want to get into a new programming language or advance in a language they already know.

The idea is to work everyday 30 minutes on an implementation of game of life. After 30 minutes stop. and the next day start from scratch. If you get to a point where you are feeling comfortable
to do this in 30 minutes you may set constraints to yourself. Like do not use loops, do not use a certain data structure. Do not delete code you already wrote. write code backward. Be creative.
